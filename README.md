### Description

Here's something I needed in a hurry ... so I took a program from Sparq (create a calendar), a program from Patrick Moore (screenshot saver), and a program from Ian Ippolito (make wallpaper). I combined them to create a calendar for wallpaper that I can enter comments in for each day. The calendar is always there as my wallpaper ... thanks to those three authors, I didn't have to write them all myself. I won't miss any more appointments now.
